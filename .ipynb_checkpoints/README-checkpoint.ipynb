    "\n",
    "For our first project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States. We'll seek to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors influencing participation rates and scores in various states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, you will be asked to come up with a data science problem. Here's a specific prompt that should help you craft this statement:\n",
    "> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a **state of your choice**.\n",

    "### Introduction on Texas focus of SAT & ACT Data\n",
    "Texas is the second largest market of SAT test with 226,374 students taking the SAT in 2018 out of the 341,613 High School Graduates or 66% of 2018 class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018 Texas represents 10.5% of all 2018 US SAT test takers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of August 2018, Texas education policy makers at Texas Education Agency have proposed a decision to require the SAT or ACT for high school students as part of their Federally Mandated testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "“In a proposed change to its administrative rules, the TEA said it would use the ACT and SAT — two standardized tests administered for college admissions — to test those students in high school, and that school districts and charter schools should pay for them.” - Texas Tribune\n",
    "\n",
    "“Specifically, the proposed amendment would modify subsection (e) to require school districts to use the SAT or ACT to fulfill federal high school assessment requirements for students who took the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR®) Algebra I EOC assessment or both the STAAR® English I and English II EOC assessments prior to high school. “\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the above proposal, how can we use the data provided to help the College Board expand the SAT in the Texas market and not lose the foothold it has to the ACT. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Insight on Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This potential change to Texas High School educational testing requirements could be good or bad for the College Board and SAT testing participation in Texas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the College Board could be on the losing side of this proposal if the Texas Legislature and school administrations deem the ACT to be a better exam for their testing needs. The SAT could lose its share of students it currently test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science problem the College Board needs to solve is to empirically prove the SAT is a better test than the ACT for the needs of the Texas Education Agency's federally mandated assessment requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal result would be to gain the rest of the Texas student population. \n",
    "\n",
    "The information we were provided (discussed above in Overview) is not sufficient to draw conclusions on the problem of empirically proving that the SAT is a better choice than the ACT for measuring student's preparation to fulfill the federally mandated assessments. \n",
    "\n",
    "As policy makers often make decisions based on average testing score results, we must avoid the pitfalls of policy makers potentially misunderstanding inverse relationship between testing participation and mean scores.\n",
